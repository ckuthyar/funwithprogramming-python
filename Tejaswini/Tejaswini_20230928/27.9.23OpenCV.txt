I've used Planets' images in for these programs and have attached all the images.

1. opcv.py is about duplicating the image
2. 3cv.py is about concatenating 2 images vertically using axis=0
3. 4cv.py is about concatenating 9 images horizontally using axis=1
4. 6cv.py is about stacking 9 images in 3*3(rows and columns) using 
   the function hstack from the library numpy
5. 7cv.py is about stacking 9 images in 3*3 using the cv2.hconcat function from the cv2 library
6. 8cv.py is about resizing the images using the function cv2.resize 
   without having to resize every image manually(I'm unable to do this one, need help)
