This assignment is to make a text file which takes the photo files directly via program(using os module)
instead of updating it manually everytime.
This text file can be used for many other programs, it's time saving.

1. We import os module and use it to get the files present in the directory
2. Create 2 lists- list1 & list2
3. Append the files in directory to list1
4. Now use for loop and if condition to check which files are photos and which aren't
5. We'll have to use else as well because the extention of the photos can be .jpg', '.jpeg', '.png',
   now append files with these extentions to list2.
6. Now name the text file in which you want to save.
7. Open the file and write.
