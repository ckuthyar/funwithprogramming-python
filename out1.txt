Dear Boyee and Shrinatha,
Today, 20-Sep-2023 is a special day for me.  I started by entrepreneurial journey on this day, 10 years back. I remember entering the SangamOne Bangalore office (2nd floor) with zeal and vigour, with hope and enthusiasm. SangamOne Connected Services Pvt Ltd got registered officially on 12-Nov-2003 while ApnaKhata Labs Pvt Ltd was already registered. 

Today, I am running 3 separate lines of business as below
CS-Consulting -  NicheSolv, INDTech Labs, InfantryHomes, DigitalNation, BaatCheet, 
SangamOne -  Fun with Programmming (ongoing), Navatar
ApnaKhata -  ApnaKhata Mobile App (now removed from App Store)

All these require in-depth knowledge of Software, which I was lacking. Initial 7 years were managerial in nature, getting other team members to build the software by cajoling them, by paying them regular salaries, by motivating them etc.  But if I cannot guide them and they have to learn through Internet, I have no real role at all, except to fund their learning. So, in the last 3 years, my focus has been to become a good engineer by learning to build software and guide a beginner. It is almost like climbing down from the peak of Mountain1 and trying to climb the next Mountain2. This approach will yield long term returns but in the short term, it will lead to lot of pain and suffering.

I sincerely thank Nirmala, Srinivas, Preethi and Shubhra for their help, support, encouragement and motivation. They been with me at all times, although we might have had ideological differences.  I thank both of you for your stinted faith in me. I have visited your home so many times and enjoyed your wonderful hospitality.  Hema Atte has blessed me with her full heart each time I interacted with her. I got a chance to bond with Srikrishna and Sahana and exchanged wonderful ideas during our interactions in Mangalore. I promise to be a good human being and a good engineer.  I promise to do everything possible to earn a decent revenue for my family.  Today is an emotional moment for me. Hence sharing...

Thanks and Regards
- Bhava (Rao)
